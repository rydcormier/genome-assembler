Assemble a genome from a set of error prone reads or generate  
all contigs from a set of read pairs.

This program combines all the components developed for the  
Genome Assembly Programming Challenge&#8212;the final project  
for the Data Structures and Algorithms coursera specialization.

### Version 0.1
Just getting the outline of the program set up. Next up is   
adding tests and then implementations.
